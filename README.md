# Emoji Mod
This mod adds emojis to Geometry Dash! Emojis can be used in comments and level descriptions and basically any text that uses `chatFont`.

Emoji Mod uses [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) for its emojis. The same as used by Twitter, Discord, Roblox, ...

To type in an emoji, you simply type the name of the emoji surrounded by colons like so -> `:skull:`. And the mod will automatically add the emoji.

The mod works by switching out the colon texts with a picture of an emoji so for people who don't have the mod installed, they will see the colon text instead.

[A list of all emojis can be found here](https://github.com/iliashdz/EmojiMod/emojis.md)
